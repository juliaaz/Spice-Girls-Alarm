# Spice Alarm
## developed by Spice Girls
Telegram bot for learning English.

## Main files

This project contains 3 modules:
- spice_bot.py - its goal is to create a Telegram bot which generates English words for user to learn a language any time.
- data_generating.py - generates necessary data (word and its definition) and
makes a quiz.
- alarm_main.py - main alarm module. Provides a user with an opportunity
to set an alarm for needed time. Plays a sound to wake up :))
Warning!!! if you have MAC OS, then you would not be able to import winsound.
With Windows there are some issues too.

## How does it work?

When a user runs the programm (alarm_main.py), the user has an opportunity to set an alarm. Then the user can choose needed time and wait for Spice Girls
to sing a song. If the user wants to train his/her English skills, then the
QR code is a link to find a Telegram Spicy Bot. The goal is to provide the user
with tasks to learn more words (by finding a right word for the defenition bot outputs or choosing the best word which suits in context of a statement). 

This is how the main page looks like. Here the user can stop a bot or start learning new words.
